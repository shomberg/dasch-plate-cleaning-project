The DASCH astronomical plate cleaning project is developed to build and program a mechanical system to clean the astronomical plates in preparation for scanning.

This Google Code is a way to organize the programming end of the project.  All code written by all participants will be updated here in order to provide access to the Google Code for all participants, as well as to organize work.
